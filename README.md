# üè® Hotel Booking Backend (Microservices Architecture)

A scalable microservices-based backend for hotel booking applications like Booking.com or Airbnb.

---

## üìñ Overview

This project is a **hotel booking backend** built with a **microservices architecture** to support scalability and modularity. Each service is designed to be **independently deployable and scalable**, so that if user demand increases, only the required service can be scaled rather than the entire system.

The codebase follows a **layered architecture** in all services:

* **Routing Layer** ‚Äì Handles incoming requests and routing.
* **Validation Layer** ‚Äì Validates request payloads.
* **Controller Layer** ‚Äì Orchestrates request flow.
* **Service Layer** ‚Äì Contains business logic.
* **Repository Layer** ‚Äì Handles database interaction.

## üèóÔ∏è Microservices

* **Hotel Service**

  * Allows hotel owners to manage hotels (CRUD).
  * Users can browse all listed hotels.
  * Cron jobs scheduled to populate room availability for the next 31 days.

* **Booking Service**

  * Users can book hotels.
  * **Idempotent API** to avoid double booking.
  * Implements **transactions** to ensure booking integrity.

* **Notification Service**

  * Sends emails asynchronously when booking is successful.
  * Uses **Redis Queue** for async message processing.

* **Auth Service**

  * Handles user management.
  * JWT-based authentication and authorization.
  * **RBAC (Role-Based Access Control)** implemented.
  * Custom **API Gateway** and **Rate Limiting** for security and traffic control.

* **Review Service**

  * Handles review management.
  * Only users who have booked a hotel can leave reviews.

## üöÄ Getting Started

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Clone the repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/anujpal247/Airbnb-node.git
cd hotel-booking-backend

git clone https://github.com/anujpal247/Go_API_Gateway.git
```

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Setup Environment Variables

Each service should have its own `.env` file. Example for Booking Service:

```env
PORT=4001
DB_HOST=localhost
DB_USER=root
DB_PASSWORD=yourpassword
DB_NAME=booking_db
REDIS_URL=redis://localhost:6379
JWT_SECRET=your-secret
```

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ Install dependencies

For Node.js services:

```bash
cd hotel-service && npm install
```

For Go services:

```bash
cd auth-service && go mod tidy
```

### 4Ô∏è‚É£ Run services

```bash
cd hotel-service && npm run dev
cd auth-service && go run main.go
```
